              Hi, I'm Craig and thanks for visiting my portfolio which focuses on UI/UX Design.
            </h1>
            <h2 className="banner__projects--intro">
My passion for design has enabled me to pursue a career that I love, whether in  advertising with its dynamic pace of the studio, deadlines and creative teams, to the corporate world of annual reporting, strategic marketing of brands to UX/UI Design and Development of web applications.

Over the years I have gained a vast amount of knowledge in leading teams, presenting, pitching to clients, working alongside developers, managing budgets and working to tight deadlines.
